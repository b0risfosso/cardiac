Seq2Seq Model for the classification of phases of a cardiac action potential.

The repository implements a seq2seq model to classify the phases of a cardiac action potential. 

The folder contains the following files:
phases.csv - a list of the sweeps with the classification into phase 0, phase 1, phase 2, phase 3, phase 4
build-dataset.ipynb - code to build more classifications from user input
seq2seq-ecg.ipynb - code that implements the seq2seq model for the prediction task

The model suffers from lack of data in the phases function. More data, better prediction results.
